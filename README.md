# 2D-Universe
A simple game like program aimed to simulate a 2D universe. Made using LibGDX. Currently it's very early, I will add more info and screenshots when I improve it a little bit.

# How to import in Eclipse
## From scratch
First download libgdx (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) if you don't have it already. I just use the latest release (not nightly).
You will need to know how to set up a basic LibGDX project. You can learn it in the documentation of the library (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki).
Just use gdx-setup-ui to create an eclipse project, then delete the .java source files automatically generated and pull this repo inside the main project folder.
You will need a libgdx desktop starter class/project to try the program. It is automatically generated when you use gdx-setup-ui.
## Faster way
Download this (https://www.mediafire.com/?vy18urm4qqd136d) which is a zip folder with all the files needed. Then go into the 2D-Universe directory and 'git pull' so you have the latest commits. You can then import "2D-Universe" and "2D-Universe-Desktop" in eclipse. If you have problems try the first way.
