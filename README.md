2D-Universe
===========

A simple game like program aimed to simulate a 2D universe. Made using LibGDX. Currently it's very early, I will add more info and screenshots when I improve it a little bit.

How to import in Eclipse
===========

You will need to know how to set up a basic LibGDX project. You can learn it in the documentation of the library (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki).
Just use gdx-setup-ui to create an eclipse project, then delete the .java source files automatically generated and pull this repo inside the main project folder.
You will need a libgdx desktop starter class/project to try the program. It is automatically generated when you use gdx-setup-ui.
